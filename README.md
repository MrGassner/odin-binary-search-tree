# The Odin Project: Binary Search Tree

A group of data items and turned into a tree full of nodes where each left node is “lower” than each right node. The tree starts with the “root node” and any node with no children is called a “leaf node”.

## Suported Functions

* `arrSorter(arr):` Used to sort an array of numbers into crescent order
* `sortedArrayToBST(arr, start, end):` function which takes an sorted array of data and turns it into a balanced BST
* `insert(key):` accepts a value to insert 
* `deleteKey(key):` accepts a value to delete
* `findMinHeight(root):` find the minimum height of a tree
* `findMaxHeight(root):` find the maximum height of a tree
* `isBalanced(root):` check if the tree is balanced
* `find(root, key):` accepts a value and returns the node with the given value.
* `findHeight(root, key):` accepts a key and returns its height.
* `findDepth(root, key):` accepts a key and returns its depth.
* `levelOrder(root):` print all nodes of level 1 first, followed by level 2, until level h, where h is the tree’s height. 
* `preOrder(root):` print from the root to the left subtree then to the right subtree.
* `postOrder(root):` print from the left subtree to the right subtree then to the root.
* `inOrder(root):` print from the left subtree to the root then to the right subtree.
* `prettyPrint(root):` console.log the binary search tree in a structured format.
